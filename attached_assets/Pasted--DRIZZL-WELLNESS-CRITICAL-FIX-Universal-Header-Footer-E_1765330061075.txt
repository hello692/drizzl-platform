# DRIZZL WELLNESS - CRITICAL FIX: Universal Header & Footer

## 🚨 EMERGENCY FIX REQUIRED

**Problem:** Pages have different menus and footers. This is completely wrong.

**Solution:** Make header and footer IDENTICAL across ALL pages.

---

## STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE CORRECT HEADER & FOOTER

Go to `index.html` (homepage) and locate:

### The Correct Header Structure
Find the `<header>` section - it should have:
- **Left side:** Menu button + Search button
- **Center:** DRIZZL WELLNESS logo
- **Right side:** Wholesale link + User icon + Cart icon

### The Correct Mobile Menu
Find the mobile menu sidebar - it should have these EXACT sections:
- **SHOP** with subcategories
- **DISCOVER** section
- **WHOLESALE & PARTNERSHIPS** section  
- **JOIN THE SQUAD** section
- **SUPPORT** section
- **THE FINE PRINT** section

### The Correct Footer
Find the `<footer>` section - it should have:
- Multiple columns with links
- Newsletter signup ("Stay in the Loop")
- Social media icons
- Copyright text

---

## STEP 2: COPY THE EXACT HTML

**From index.html, copy these sections EXACTLY:**

### Copy Header HTML
```html
<!-- Copy everything from <header> to </header> including:
- The entire header element
- All CSS classes
- All IDs
- All data attributes
- All JavaScript references
- Mobile menu sidebar
- Everything -->
```

### Copy Footer HTML
```html
<!-- Copy everything from <footer> to </footer> including:
- The entire footer element
- All columns
- All links
- Newsletter form
- Social icons
- Copyright
- Everything -->
```

---

## STEP 3: DELETE WRONG HEADERS & FOOTERS

Go through EVERY page you created:
- shop.html
- about.html
- locations.html
- wholesale.html
- ingredients.html
- membership.html
- All product pages
- All blog pages
- All other pages

**For each page:**
1. Find the `<header>` section
2. If it's DIFFERENT from index.html → DELETE IT COMPLETELY
3. Find the `<footer>` section
4. If it's DIFFERENT from index.html → DELETE IT COMPLETELY

---

## STEP 4: PASTE CORRECT HEADER & FOOTER

**For EVERY page on the site:**

1. At the top of the page (after opening `<body>` tag), paste the EXACT header from index.html
2. At the bottom of the page (before closing `</body>` tag), paste the EXACT footer from index.html
3. Make sure ALL CSS classes are identical
4. Make sure ALL links work properly
5. Make sure mobile menu has SAME structure

---

## STEP 5: VERIFY CONSISTENCY

Check that EVERY page now has:

### Identical Header
- [ ] Menu button (opens same mobile menu)
- [ ] Search button
- [ ] DRIZZL WELLNESS logo (centered)
- [ ] Wholesale link
- [ ] User icon
- [ ] Cart icon
- [ ] Same styling and spacing
- [ ] Same dynamic color behavior (dark/light switching)

### Identical Mobile Menu
- [ ] Opens with same animation
- [ ] Shows EXACT same sections:
  - SHOP (with subcategories)
  - DISCOVER
  - WHOLESALE & PARTNERSHIPS
  - JOIN THE SQUAD
  - SUPPORT
  - THE FINE PRINT
- [ ] All links go to correct pages
- [ ] Same styling throughout

### Identical Footer
- [ ] Same column structure
- [ ] Same links in each column
- [ ] Newsletter signup form
- [ ] Social media icons (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter)
- [ ] Copyright text
- [ ] Same styling and spacing

---

## STEP 6: MAKE IT MAINTAINABLE

**Best Practice:** Create reusable header/footer components

### Option A: Include Files (if using PHP or similar)
```php
<?php include 'includes/header.php'; ?>
<!-- Page content here -->
<?php include 'includes/footer.php'; ?>
```

### Option B: JavaScript Template (if using plain HTML)
```javascript
// Load header and footer dynamically
fetch('components/header.html')
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(html => document.getElementById('header').innerHTML = html);

fetch('components/footer.html')
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(html => document.getElementById('footer').innerHTML = html);
```

### Option C: Copy-Paste (if no build system)
If you can't use includes:
- Keep one master copy of header in a comment
- Keep one master copy of footer in a comment
- When updating, update ALL pages at once
- Use find-and-replace across all files

## STEP 7: FIX ALL LINKS IN HEADER/FOOTER

Make sure these links work on EVERY page:

### Header Links
- Logo → `/` or `/index.html` (homepage)
- Wholesale → `/wholesale.html`
- Account icon → `/account.html` or `/login.html`
- Cart icon → `/cart.html`

### Mobile Menu Links
Check EVERY link goes to the correct page:

**SHOP section:**
- Smoothies → `/shop.html` or `/shop.html?category=smoothies`
- Protein Power-Ups → `/shop.html?category=protein`
- Fan Favorites → `/shop.html?category=favorites`

### Footer Links
Same links as mobile menu, organized in columns

### Social Media Icons
