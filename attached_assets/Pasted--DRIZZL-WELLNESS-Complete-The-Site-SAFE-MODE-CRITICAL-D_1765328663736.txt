## STEP 1: AUDIT THE CURRENT SITE

Before making ANY changes, analyze:

### Check The Menu Navigation
Look at the menu sidebar - identify which links go nowhere:
- Shop section links
- About section links
- Locations link
- Wholesale link
- Ingredients link
- Membership link
- Any other menu items

### Check The Footer
Look at the footer - identify which links are broken:

- Any "Add to Cart" buttons
- Any "Learn More" buttons
- Search button
- Account button
- Cart button

### Make a List
Create a list of ONLY the missing/broken pages that need to be created.

### Current Technical Structure

---

## STEP 3: CREATE MISSING PAGES ONLY

- Use the SAME color scheme
- Use the SAME spacing/padding system
- Use the SAME button styles
- Use the SAME card designs
- Match the SAME overall aesthetic
- Be responsive in the SAME way

### Content Requirements
Generate appropriate, realistic content for each page:

#### For Product Pages:
- Product name
- Price ($7.99 - $9.99 range)
- Product image placeholder or description
- 100-150 word description (fun, benefit-focused)
- Ingredients list (realistic smoothie ingredients)

}
```

### Forms
