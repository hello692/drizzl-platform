# DRIZZL WELLNESS — UI CLARITY SYSTEM

## Purpose
Transform the Drizzl Wellness website into a premium, calm, high-converting experience using **hierarchy, spacing, and emphasis only** — without removing any fonts, content, or features.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

**Re-orchestrate, don't redesign.**

You are changing:
- Visual dominance
- Spacing rhythm
- Content sequencing
- Interaction timing

You are NOT changing:
- Fonts
- Content
- Images
- Features

---

## PART 1: TYPOGRAPHY HIERARCHY

### The Problem
Most websites fail because everything has equal visual weight — everything "shouts" at once.

### The Solution: Three-Tier Content System

| Tier | Content Type | Treatment |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **Tier 1 — Primary** | Hero headline, main subline, primary CTA | Full contrast, largest size, normal weight |
| **Tier 2 — Supporting** | Benefits, ingredients, lifestyle copy | Same font, smaller size OR lighter color |
| **Tier 3 — Reference** | Nutrition facts, secondary CTAs, footer | Same font, 70–80% opacity |

### Font Role Assignment
Each font gets ONE job:
- **Font A** → Emotional headlines
- **Font B** → Functional body copy  
- **Font C** → Utility (labels, buttons, data)

If the same font serves multiple roles, differentiate through **size + spacing**, not by adding new fonts.

---

## PART 2: VERTICAL SPACING SYSTEM

Spacing creates the "premium" feel. Use a fixed scale — never eyeball.

| Element | Spacing |
|---------|---------|
| Between major sections | 96–120px |
| Between content blocks | 48–64px |
| Between heading + paragraph | 16–24px |
| Line height | 1.5–1.6x |
| Max paragraph width | 640–720px |

**Rule:** Consistent spacing beats clever design.

---

## PART 3: VISUAL CONTRAST GRADIENT

Most sites use maximum contrast everywhere. Premium brands don't.

| Page Position | Contrast Level |
|---------------|----------------|
| Hero (above fold) | 100% |
| Mid-page content | 85–90% |
| Reference/footer | 70–75% |

Same fonts. Same content. Different perceptual weight.

---

## PART 4: HERO SECTION

### Requirements
- One clear message
- One clear action
- One dominant image

### Specifications
- Hero headline: **largest text on site**
- Subheadline: lighter weight, smaller size
- **ONE primary CTA** — solid, high contrast
- Secondary CTAs: outline style or reduced opacity
- Alignment: choose center OR left — stay consistent

---

## PART 5: CTA PRIORITY RULE

At any scroll position, the user should face:
- **One question**
- **One decision**

### Button Hierarchy
| Type | Style |
|------|-------|
| Primary | Solid background, high contrast |
| Secondary | Outline only |
| Utility | Text link, no background |

**Never show multiple "loud" buttons at once.**

---

## PART 6: CONTENT SEQUENCING

Arrange content like a conversation:

1. **Identity** — "What is Drizzl?"
2. **Promise** — "What does it do for me?"
3. **Proof** — Ingredients, benefits, nutrition
4. **Action** — Buy / Subscribe / Find Near You

You already have this content. Space it across the scroll journey.

---

## PART 7: INTERFACE SILENCING

Reduce visual noise without removing elements:

| Element | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| Secondary buttons | Outline only |
| Icons | Lighter color / reduced opacity |
| Badges | Smaller size, tighter padding |
| Emphasis | Hover reveals, not permanent |

**The interface should wait for the user.**

---

## PART 8: IMAGE RULES

- Hero: ONE dominant image
- Product images: consistent size and spacing
- Breathing room: 48–64px above and below images
- No tight stacking

**Images support text — they don't compete with it.**

---

## PART 9: MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS

| Rule | Specification |
|------|---------------|
| Layout | Single column |
| Text width | Respect max-width |
| Button height | Minimum 44px |
| Padding | Adequate for touch |
| Spacing | Scale down proportionally, don't collapse |

---

## PART 10: FRICTION REMOVAL

Remove friction, not features:

- ✅ Auto-focus email input on subscription forms
- ✅ Keep cart visible but not dominant
- ✅ Smooth transitions between sections
- ❌ No modal interruptions
- ❌ No autoplay video with sound
- ❌ No aggressive shadows or animations

---

## PART 11: PERFORMANCE

- No layout shifts during load
- No blocking loaders
- Smooth scroll and interactions
- Maintain logical focus flow (inputs → CTAs)

**Perceived smoothness > visual effects.**

---

## QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before marking complete, verify:

- [ ] Page feels calmer without losing content
- [ ] Eye naturally flows top → bottom
- [ ] Brand feels premium and confident
- [ ] User understands Drizzl in **5 seconds**
- [ ] No element feels like it's "shouting"
- [ ] One clear CTA at every scroll position
- [ ] Spacing is systematic, not arbitrary

---

## THE LITMUS TEST

> "Can someone understand Drizzl in 5 seconds without reading everything?"

If yes, you succeeded.

## SUMMARY

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Enforce hierarchy | Delete fonts |
| Systemize spacing | Delete content |
| Control emphasis | Rebuild the site |
| Sequence information | Add new elements |
| Respect attention | Over-explain |
