✅ MASTER PROMPT — DRIZZL WELLNESS ADMIN DASHBOARD (FULL SYSTEM UPGRADE)

Redesign and upgrade the entire Drizzl Wellness Admin Dashboard into a high-end, Apple-level, AI-powered operating system for the company. This is not a static icon dashboard — it must be a fully live, data-driven command center.
