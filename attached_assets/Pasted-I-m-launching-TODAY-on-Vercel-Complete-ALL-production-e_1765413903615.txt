Execute these 4 tasks IN ORDER, do not stop until complete:

## 🔥 TASK 1: SUPABASE DATABASE CONNECTION FOR ALL PRODUCTS

1. Create/verify these Supabase tables exist:
   - products (id, name, description, price, images, category, stock, vendor_id, status, created_at)
   - categories (id, name, slug, image, parent_id)
   - orders (id, user_id, items, total, status, shipping_address, created_at)
   - order_items (id, order_id, product_id, quantity, price)
   - users (id, email, name, role, avatar, created_at)
   - vendors (id, user_id, store_name, logo, description, status)
   
2. Replace ALL hardcoded product data with Supabase queries
3. Connect shop page, product pages, search, and categories to real database
4. Ensure cart saves to database for logged-in users
5. Orders save to database on checkout completion

Show me the Supabase connection code and confirm each table is created.
