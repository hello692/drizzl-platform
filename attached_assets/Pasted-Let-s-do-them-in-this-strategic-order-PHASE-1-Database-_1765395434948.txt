Let's do them in this strategic order:

PHASE 1: Database Integration (DO THIS FIRST)
Connect all portals to real Supabase database. This is the foundation - everything else depends on it.

Tasks:
1. Set up Supabase project
2. Create all database tables (users, customers, partners, products, orders, invoices, etc.)
3. Migrate all demo data to real database
4. Update all three portals (Admin, B2B, D2C) to query Supabase instead of mock data
5. Test data flow: Admin creates product → Shows in B2B pricing → Shows in D2C store

Start with this now. Walk me through the Supabase setup process.

PHASE 2: Real Authentication (DO THIS SECOND)
Replace demo passwords with real auth.

Tasks:
1. Set up Supabase Auth
2. Replace "customer123" / "partner123" with real auth flow
3. Add password hashing (bcrypt)
4. Session management with JWT tokens
5. Password reset functionality
6. Email verification (optional for now)

Do this after database is connected.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PHASE 3: D2C Storefront (DO THIS THIRD)
Build the public shopping experience at /shop

Pages needed:
- /shop - Homepage with featured products
- /shop/products - All products grid
- /shop/products/[id] - Single product page
- /shop/cart - Shopping cart
- /shop/checkout - Checkout flow

This comes after database + auth because customers need to log in to checkout.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PHASE 4: Payment Processing (DO THIS FOURTH)
Add Stripe for real payments.

Integration points:
- D2C checkout: One-time purchases
- D2C checkout: Subscriptions
- B2B invoices: ACH/Wire payments
- Save payment methods

Do this after storefront is built.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PHASE 5: Deploy & Polish (DO THIS LAST)
Launch the app to production.

Tasks:
1. Environment variables for production
2. Deploy to Vercel/Railway/Replit Deploy
3. Connect custom domain
4. SSL certificates
5. Performance optimization
6. Final testing

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

START NOW WITH PHASE 1: Database Integration

Walk me through setting up Supabase:
1. What do I need to do to create a Supabase project?
2. What tables do we need?
3. How do we migrate the demo data?
4. Show me the code changes needed to connect to Supabase

Let's do this step by step. Start with instructions for Supabase setup.
