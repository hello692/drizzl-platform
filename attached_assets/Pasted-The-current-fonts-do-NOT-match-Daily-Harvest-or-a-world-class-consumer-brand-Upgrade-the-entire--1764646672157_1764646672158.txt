The current fonts do NOT match Daily Harvest or a world-class consumer brand.

Upgrade the entire site’s typography system to a premium, modern, editorial wellness brand standard.

Font system must meet the following requirements:

1. PRIMARY BRAND FONT (Headlines & Logo Feel)
   - Use a modern, clean, slightly editorial sans-serif like:
     - Inter
     - SF Pro
     - Neue Haas Grotesk (or closest web-safe equivalent)
     - Or equivalent premium grotesk font
   - Applied to:
     - Logo text
     - Navigation
     - Section headlines (H1, H2, H3)
     - Product names

2. BODY & UI FONT
   - Use a highly readable premium UI font:
     - Inter
     - System UI
     - Or equivalent
   - Applied to:
     - Descriptions
     - Forms
     - Buttons
     - Footer
     - Blog & FAQ text

3. TYPOGRAPHY SCALE
   Implement a proper world-class type scale:
   - H1: Large hero editorial size
   - H2: Section titles
   - H3: Product titles
   - Body: Clean readable paragraph size
   - Small/UI: Labels, disclaimers

4. LETTER SPACING & WEIGHT
   - Logo & nav should have:
     - Slight tracking (letter spacing)
     - Medium weight (not bold)
   - No heavy default browser fonts anywhere

5. GLOBAL IMPLEMENTATION
   - Apply fonts globally via:
     - Next.js font system OR
     - Tailwind font config
   - Remove all default browser font usage
   - Every page must inherit the same brand type system:
     - Auth
     - Homepage
     - Shop
     - Product pages
     - Cart
     - Footer
     - Admin

6. DAILY HARVEST STYLE REFERENCE
   - Match the FEEL of dailyharvest.com:
     - Clean
     - Editorial
     - Premium
     - Spacious
     - Friendly but upscale
   - Do NOT use any “tech SaaS” fonts.

7. AFTER IMPLEMENTING:
   - Show me the exact font names used
   - Show me where they are configured
   - Confirm every major section is updated

Do NOT continue building features until this typography system is correctly implemented.
