You are a luxury typography engineer.

Study the visual characteristics of Louis Vuitton / LVMH website typography.

Your task: recreate an original type system that visually matches their hierarchy and proportions — elegant, fashion editorial, premium, calm — but is newly drawn so it does not infringe their IP.

Font family name: “Drizzl Maison Serif”.

Create the full type system with these roles:

1) **DRIZZL MAISON DISPLAY** (for big page titles like HISTORY)
   • Strong Didone fashion serif
   • All caps capability
   • Optical size tuned for 48–120px
   • Slight bolding vs body text
   • Long vertical stems
   • Tall cap height
   • Tight tracking similar to LVMH headlines

2) **DRIZZL MAISON SUBTITLE** (used under titles)
   • Small caps OR sentence case with light spacing
   • Medium weight, calm tone
   • Lower contrast than Display
   • Designed around 18–30px
   • Slightly wider spacing

3) **DRIZZL MAISON TEXT** (paragraphs like their history copy)
   • Smooth modern serif
   • Humanist rhythm — NOT Bodoni sharpness
   • Low contrast compared to Display
   • Optimized for 14–19px
   • Less dramatic serifs for readability
   • Soft stress transitions

==== REQUIRED OUTPUT STRUCTURE ====

A) Provide SVG paths for uppercase A–Z in all three styles
B) Provide lowercase a–z for Text and Subtitle styles
C) Give numerals 0–9
D) Provide kerning pairs and tracking guidance:
   • Titles: -2% tight
   • Subtitles: neutral spacing
   • Body: +1% airy readability

E) Stroke contrast ratios:
   • Display: 10:1 contrast
   • Subtitle: 6:1 contrast
   • Text: 4:1 contrast

F) Serif geometry:
   • Horizontal hairline
   • Bracketed into stems
   • Subtle flared terminals
   • Organic curves instead of mechanical ones

G) Usage rules:
   • Section title (HISTORY style) = Display, all caps, 2.8rem
   • Under-title sentence text = Subtitle, sentence case, 1.1rem
   • Long content paragraphs = Text, 1rem, line height 1.55

H) Export recommendation:
   • Variable axis: opsz (text → display)
   • Weight axis: 300–600

Ensure the aesthetic replicates the LVMH website feel — editorial luxury serif with poised balance — but redraw everything unique and original.

Return the design cleanly formatted.
