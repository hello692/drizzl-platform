## 🎯 OBJECTIVE 1: FULL RESPONSIVE DESIGN AUDIT

Scan EVERY page, component, and element across the entire codebase and ensure:

### Device Breakpoints to Support:
- Mobile Small: 320px - 375px (iPhone SE)
- Mobile Medium: 376px - 428px (iPhone 14/15, Pixel)
- Mobile Large: 429px - 480px (iPhone Pro Max, large Android)
- Tablet Portrait: 481px - 768px
- Tablet Landscape: 769px - 1024px
- Desktop: 1025px - 1440px
- Large Desktop: 1441px+

### For EACH breakpoint, verify and fix:
1. **Typography** - Font sizes scale proportionally (use clamp() or fluid typography)
2. **Spacing** - Margins, padding, gaps adjust per viewport
3. **Images/Media** - Properly responsive, no overflow, correct aspect ratios
4. **Navigation** - Mobile menu works, desktop nav displays correctly
5. **Buttons/CTAs** - Touch-friendly on mobile (min 44px tap targets)
6. **Forms** - Inputs are accessible and properly sized on all devices
7. **Grids/Layouts** - Flex/Grid properly collapse and reflow
8. **Modals/Popups** - Centered and scrollable on small screens
9. **Tables** - Horizontally scrollable or stack on mobile
10. **Text truncation** - No overflow, proper ellipsis where needed

### Implementation Standard:
```css
/* Use this pattern for all responsive elements */
.element {
  font-size: clamp(1rem, 2.5vw, 1.5rem);
  padding: clamp(1rem, 3vw, 2rem);
  gap: clamp(0.5rem, 2vw, 1.5rem);
}
```
