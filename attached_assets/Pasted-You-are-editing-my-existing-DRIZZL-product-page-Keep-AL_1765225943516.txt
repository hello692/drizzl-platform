You are editing my existing DRIZZL product page. 
Keep ALL content, fonts, and colors strictly black & white (no other colors). 
Make the layout and scroll behavior inspired by the Louis Vuitton High Rise product page, but use fully original HTML/CSS/JS — do NOT copy their code or text.

GOAL
- Desktop: two-column luxury layout.
  - LEFT: tall, full-height image gallery that scrolls vertically.
  - RIGHT: product information panel that stays fixed (sticky) while the user scrolls, like on the LV page.
- Mobile/tablet: stack sections (images first, product info below) with normal scroll.

DETAIL LAYOUT

1. MAIN WRAPPER
- Wrap the product section in a container, e.g. `.product-page`.
- Use a 2-column flex or grid layout on desktop:
  - `.product-main { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 60% 40%; gap: 48px; align-items: flex-start; }`
  - On screens under ~1024px, switch to 1 column.

2. LEFT COLUMN (IMAGE GALLERY)
- Class: `.product-gallery`.
- This column should create the scrollable height.
- Inside, stack several large product images ONE UNDER THE OTHER (not a small slider), each with 100% width and nice border-radius.
- As the user scrolls down the page, they see more images (front, side, top, lifestyle, etc.), just like on LV.
- Let the page itself scroll normally; the left column is simply tall.
- Optional: add a thumbnail row at the bottom or top, but the key is a vertical series of big images.

3. RIGHT COLUMN (STICKY INFO PANEL)
- Class: `.product-info`.
- Make this column STICKY so it does NOT move when the user scrolls:
  - `.product-info { position: sticky; top: 80px; align-self: flex-start; }`
- Content order:
  - Product name (e.g. "Acai")
  - Short subtitle (e.g. "Inspired by the Amazon in a cup")
  - Price (`$9.49`)
  - Star rating + review count.
  - BIG primary CTA button (full-width, pill shape): "Add to Cart" (black background, white text).
  - Small secondary text link: "View all smoothies →".
  - A thin divider line.
  - Below, turn the long text sections into an accordion (see next step).

4. ACCORDION SECTIONS ON THE RIGHT
Transform the text sections into a luxury-style accordion, similar to LV:

- Sections:
  1) "About this smoothie"
  2) "How to prepare"
  3) "Nutrition & Ingredients"
  4) "Delivery & Returns"
- Structure:
  - Each section is a row with:
    - Left: title.
    - Right: a "+" / "–" icon.
  - Clicking on the row toggles visibility of the content below.
- Use simple JS (no frameworks) to open/close sections.
- Default state:
  - "About this smoothie" open.
  - The rest closed.
- Style: black text on white, thin gray `border-top` and `border-bottom`, generous padding to feel premium.

5. BLACK & WHITE STYLING
- Background: pure white (#ffffff).
- Text: almost black (#111111 or #000000).
- Buttons:
  - Primary "Add to Cart": black background, white text, large pill, smooth hover (slight scale or opacity).
  - Secondary links: plain text with underline on hover.
- Remove or neutralize any unnecessary colors (badges, tags) so the whole page is monochrome.
- Keep DRIZZL logo in white on black header bar, as is.

6. RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
- Desktop:
  - Two columns with sticky right panel working correctly.
  - As I scroll, ONLY the LEFT side appears to move because the RIGHT side uses `position: sticky`.
- Tablet:
  - You can still keep two columns if there is enough width, but reduce gaps and font sizes.
- Mobile:
  - Switch to one column: images first, product info + accordion below.
  - Disable sticky on very small screens if needed by media query (so layout doesn’t break).

7. CLEANUP
- Do NOT change routes, state logic, or cart functionality.
- Only refactor the product page markup, CSS, and minimal JS to achieve:
  - vertical image gallery on the left,
  - sticky product info panel on the right,
  - black & white luxury aesthetic similar to a high-end fashion house.

Update the existing files (React components or HTML/CSS/JS) rather than creating a totally new page, and keep all existing DRIZZL content, text, and prices.
