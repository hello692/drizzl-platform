You are editing the DRIZZL product detail page.

GOAL
- Move ALL accordion content into the RIGHT product info panel under the price and CTA.
- Remove the separate full-width black section at the bottom.
- Final look: a single, clean, black-and-white accordion on a white background in the right column (like Louis Vuitton’s product info).

1. REMOVE BOTTOM BLACK SECTION
Find the section that renders the full-width black accordion (Ingredients, Nutrition, About, Key Ingredients, How to Prepare) at the bottom of the page.

It likely has a wrapper like:
  <section className="..."> or <div className="details-section dark"> 

Delete this entire block OR stop rendering it on this page.

2. RIGHT-SIDE ACCORDION CONTENT
Extend the existing accordion inside the RIGHT column (below "About this smoothie") so it includes all the items we need.

Final accordion items (in this order):

  1) About this smoothie
  2) Ingredients
  3) Nutrition
  4) Key Ingredients
  5) How to prepare
  6) Delivery & Returns

Use the existing "About this smoothie" text for the first item.

For the others, reuse the content that was previously in the big black section (Ingredients / Nutrition / About / Key Ingredients / How to Prepare). Map it as follows:

- "Ingredients" -> goes into the "Ingredients" accordion item.
- "Nutrition" -> goes into the "Nutrition" accordion item.
- "About" + "Key Ingredients" -> split into "About this smoothie" and "Key Ingredients" or keep the headings as appropriate.
- "How to Prepare" -> goes into the "How to prepare" accordion item.

3. UNIFIED WHITE STYLING
Make sure the RIGHT-SIDE accordion uses ONLY black text on a white background:

Accordion wrapper:

.details-accordion {
  background: #ffffff;
  color: #000000;
  border-top: 1px solid #e5e5e5;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e5e5;
}

Accordion row/headline:

.details-accordion-item {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
  padding: 16px 0;
  border-top: 1px solid #e5e5e5;
}

.details-accordion-title {
  font-size: 0.95rem;
  font-weight: 500;
}

.details-accordion-subtitle {
  font-size: 0.8rem;
  color: #777777;
}

.details-accordion-icon {
  font-size: 1rem;
}

Accordion content:

.details-accordion-content {
  padding: 0 0 16px;
  font-size: 0.9rem;
  line-height: 1.6;
  color: #333333;
}

4. ACCORDION BEHAVIOR
Reuse your existing JS logic for open/close. Each item should toggle with a "+" / "–" icon on the right.

Default state:
- "About this smoothie" open.
- All other items closed.

5. TAGS
Keep the dietary tags (Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free, Made from Plants, Superfood) under the accordion as they are, but ensure they also use black/gray on white (no colored badges).

.summary: 
- Remove the separate dark section.
- Show one single, clean, white accordion with all sections inside the right product info column.
- Ensure the entire page remains black text on white background with subtle gray dividers.
