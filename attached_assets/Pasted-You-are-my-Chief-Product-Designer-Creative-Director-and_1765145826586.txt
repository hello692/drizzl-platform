You are my Chief Product Designer, Creative Director, and Senior UX Architect.

OBJECTIVE
Redesign and refactor the ENTIRE smoothie website so it feels like a billion-dollar wellness brand.

Your focus is:
- UI/UX architecture
- Page structure
- Section layouts
- Grid systems
- Typography, spacing, buttons, components
- Overall interaction + flow

NOT copy or wording from other brands.

INSPIRATION SITES (FOR STRUCTURE ONLY)
Study these deeply for layout, section patterns, hierarchy, UX, and storytelling — NOT for copying text or visuals:
- https://drywater.com/
- https://drinkag1.com/
- https://daily-harvest.com/
- https://www.mudwtrgather.com/
- https://ouraring.com/
- https://ai.google/societal-impact/

Take the BEST ideas and section types from all of them and combine into one superior system.

COLOR CONSTRAINT
- Website must stay BLACK & WHITE ONLY (monochrome).
- You may use multiple shades of grey for depth, hierarchy, borders, and backgrounds.
- No brand colors, no color accents. The “color” is typography, layout, and photography.

BRAND CONTEXT
- Product: premium frozen smoothies.
- Brand energy: Fresh. Frozen. Fantastic. Smoothies that make life feel better.
- Emotional language: “I Feel Good / I Feel Better / I Feel Me.”
- Positioning: premium, minimal, confident, Apple/Oura-level calm.

TECH ASSUMPTIONS
- Assume React (or Next.js) with components.
- Assume some global CSS or utility approach.
- You may reorganize components and styles but must not break nav, cart, or routing.

------------------------------------------------
1. GLOBAL DESIGN SYSTEM (BLACK & WHITE)
------------------------------------------------
Define and enforce a single global design system for the site:

A) Typography
- Choose a modern, humanist sans-serif type style (Apple / Oura inspired).
- Define a full scale:
  - H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6
  - Lead / intro text
  - Body, small body
  - Overline / eyebrow
  - Button text
- For each, specify:
  - Font size
  - Weight
  - Line height
  - Letter-spacing
- Define mobile vs desktop behavior (e.g. clamp or separate sizes).
- Headings should feel bold and confident; body highly readable.

B) Color Palette (Monochrome)
- Define tokens like:
  - bg-main (white)
  - bg-alt (light grey)
  - text-main (black)
  - text-muted (grey)
  - border-subtle (light grey)
  - border-strong (dark grey)
- Keep everything black/white/grey, no accent colors.
- Use contrast and negative space instead of color to guide the eye.

C) Spacing & Layout
- Define a spacing scale (e.g. 4/8/12/16/24/32/40/56/72).
- Set rules for:
  - Vertical space between sections
  - Padding inside sections and cards
  - Max content width (e.g. 1200–1280px)
  - Grid system (e.g. 12-column layout on desktop, 1-column on mobile)
- The site should feel airy, calm, and structured like Oura / Apple.

D) Components
Define reusable UI building blocks:
- Buttons: primary, secondary, ghost — all in black/white with subtle hover states.
- Text links.
- Cards: product cards, benefit cards, story cards.
- Badges: small monochrome tags (e.g. “Gluten-free”, “No junk”).
- Inputs: text fields, selects, checkboxes.
- Navigation: header nav, mobile nav, sticky behavior.
- Banner / CTA components.
- Accordions (for FAQ).
- Comparison tables.
- Section wrappers with consistent padding and max-width.

For each component:
- Specify default, hover, active, focus, disabled.
- Make everything accessible (contrast, focus outlines, semantic HTML).

E) Motion & Interaction
- Subtle, tasteful animations:
  - Slight fade/slide on scroll into view.
  - Minimal hover lift for cards & buttons.
- No flashy or aggressive transitions; everything should feel calm and intentional.

------------------------------------------------
2. SITE-WIDE INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
------------------------------------------------
Define the full site IA like a billion-dollar brand.

At minimum design these page types:

1) Home / Landing
2) Shop / All Smoothies
3) Product Detail Page
4) Bundles / Build Your Box
5) How It Works (Ritual)
6) Benefits / Ingredients / “What’s Inside”
7) About / Brand Story
8) Impact / Sustainability / Societal Benefit
9) FAQ / Help Center
10) Account (Sign In / Sign Up / Profile)
11) Cart & Checkout
12) Wholesale / Partners / B2B
13) Journal / Blog (optional but recommended)

For EACH page:
- Define its primary goal (e.g. “Home should drive to shop and explain why the brand exists”).
- List the sections in order using your best understanding from Drywater, AG1, Daily Harvest, MUD/WTR, Oura, and Google AI.
- Use the global design system and components consistently.

------------------------------------------------
3. SECTION & PAGE LAYOUT – BEST OF ALL WORLDS
------------------------------------------------
Using the inspiration sites, pick the best section patterns and fuse them into one system.

Examples (you must design these, not just list them):

HOME
- Hero section with “I Feel…” copy, simple CTA, and strong monochrome layout.
- “Why these smoothies exist” (problem/solution narrative).
- “What’s in the cup” benefits grid (AG1 + Daily Harvest style).
- “How it works” 3-step ritual (AG1 pattern).
- Comparison table (smoothies vs juice bar vs bottled vs snacks).
- Lifestyle / use-case cards (Oura-like storytelling, Daily Harvest scenario blocks).
- Social proof / reviews / logos.
- Impact/purpose band (inspired by Google AI societal-impact and Oura’s responsible tone).
- FAQ preview.
- Final CTA banner.

SHOP
- Filter bar (category, function, flavor).
- Clean product grid (monochrome, minimal).
- Hover states with subtle details (e.g. “view details” or “add to box”).

PRODUCT DETAIL
- Large product image section.
- Clear summary top area (name, short description, key benefits).
- Nutrition / ingredients / prep instructions – organized with tabs or accordions.
- “Perfect for” use-cases.
- Reviews / ratings.
- Upsell / related products.

HOW IT WORKS
- 3-step ritual section.
- “Day in the life” layout showing when you drink smoothies.
- Visual timeline section.

BENEFITS / WHAT’S INSIDE
- Ingredient categories (energy, mood, gut, etc.).
- Always / Never list (like AG1 & Drywater).
- Monochrome icon grid with strong alignment and spacing.

ABOUT
- Brand story, mission, values.
- “The world we want to build” style narrative inspired by Google AI societal impact and Oura’s tone.

IMPACT
- Sections on health, environment, community.
- Timeline or pillars block.

FAQ
- Strong accordion layout.
- Group questions by topics.

WHOLESALE / PARTNERS
- B2B pitch blocks.
- Benefits for shops / cafés / gyms.
- Clear CTA for partnerships.

CART & CHECKOUT
- Minimal, high-clarity layout.
- Easy-to-read summary.
- Clear steps and progress indication.

------------------------------------------------
4. APPLY BLACK & WHITE STYLE CONSISTENTLY
------------------------------------------------
For every page and section:
- Use the typography and spacing rules.
- Use the monochrome palette only.
- Use consistent buttons and card styles everywhere.
- Maintain alignment and grid consistency to make the whole site feel like one cohesive system.

Make typography + negative space the “brand color.”

------------------------------------------------
5. DELIVERABLE FORMAT
------------------------------------------------
Your output must include:

1) Global Design System
   - Typography tokens.
   - Color tokens (black/white/grey).
   - Spacing scale.
   - Button and component styles.
   - Motion/interaction rules.

2) Component Architecture
   - Suggested component structure (e.g., `/components/Button`, `/components/SectionHero`, `/components/ProductCard`, `/components/FAQAccordion`, etc.).
   - Which components are reused on which pages.

3) Page Layout Blueprints
   - For each key page, list sections in the exact order they should appear.
   - For each section, describe:
     - Layout (columns, grids).
     - What content type goes there (headline, body, cards, table, etc.).
     - Which components are used.

4) Example Markup (React/JSX or semantic HTML)
   - Show sample structure for:
     - Home
     - Shop
     - Product Detail
     - Benefits
     - About
     - Impact
     - FAQ
   - Use semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) and the component system.

5) On-Brand Placeholder Copy (Short)
   - No lorem ipsum.
   - Short, clean English that fits a premium black & white smoothie wellness brand.
   - You don’t need long essays — this is UI copy.

6) Notes for Implementation
   - How to handle responsive behavior.
   - Where images or videos should go.
   - How scroll animations should be applied (e.g., fade-up on section enter).

FINAL GOAL
The result should be:
- A fully defined UI/UX architecture for the entire site.
- A reusable component and layout system.
- A black-and-white, minimal, premium aesthetic.
- A site that feels like the BEST-designed smoothie/wellness brand in the world, borrowing the strongest ideas from Drywater, AG1, Daily Harvest, MUD/WTR, Oura, and Google AI’s societal impact storytelling — without copying any of them.
