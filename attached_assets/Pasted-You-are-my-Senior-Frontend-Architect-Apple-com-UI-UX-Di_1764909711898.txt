You are my Senior Frontend Architect + Apple.com UI/UX Director.
Your mission:

Make the ENTIRE website visually perfect, consistent, aligned, responsive, and premium — exactly like Apple.com.

This applies to every single page, component, and text element, not just the landing page.

WHAT MUST BE FIXED & PERFECTED (SITE-WIDE)
1. Global Layout + Alignment (ALL PAGES)

Apply a universal max-width container so all content is perfectly centered and never stretched or awkward on large screens.

Every section must follow the same container alignment.

Remove ANY empty or weird spacing on widescreen monitors.

Align logo, navigation, hero text, buttons, images, product cards, and footers to the exact same vertical grid.

Nothing should float off to the left or right.

2. Fully Responsive Framework (ALL DEVICES)

The entire website must look flawless on:

Ultrawide screens (1600–2400px)

Desktop (1440px)

Laptop (1024px)

Tablet (768px)

Mobile (375–480px)

All content must resize, reposition, and reflow perfectly in a way that feels premium, intentional, and Apple-level.

3. Apple-Level Typography System (GLOBAL)

Create and apply one unified typography system across the entire site:

Clean hierarchy

Perfect text sizes

Fluid scaling for mobile

Ideal line-height

Elegant spacing

Casing rules (Apple standard):

H1/H2 → Title Case

H3/H4/H5 → Sentence case

Buttons → Title Case

Navigation → Title Case

Product labels → Title Case

Descriptions → Sentence case

No random capitals. No inconsistent text sizes.
Everything must be unified and luxurious.

4. Spacing + Rhythm + Whitespace (GLOBAL)

Fix ALL spacing site-wide:

Consistent section padding

Consistent vertical rhythm

Proper margins above/below headings

Balanced whitespace that feels intentional, not empty

No cramped content anywhere

No giant wasted whitespace anywhere

Spacing must look mathematically perfect on all screen sizes.

5. Component Consistency (GLOBAL)

Fix and unify:

Buttons

Product cards

Banners

Images

Icons

Grid systems

Forms

Footer

Mobile menu

Every component must share the same design language.

6. Visual Polish (GLOBAL)

Everything must look world-class, modern, luxurious, and pixel-perfect.
Think:

📱 Apple.com
⚡️ Clean
🖥 Minimal
✨ Confident
🧊 Premium geometric typography
🪄 Smooth spacing and alignment

DELIVERABLES (MANDATORY)
1. Full Global Layout System

(max-widths, breakpoints, containers, grids)

2. Full Typography System

(font sizes, weights, line heights, casing rules)

3. Full Spacing System

(global margins, paddings, vertical rhythm)

4. Full Site Rewrite

Fix and rewrite text where needed for consistency:

All headings

All paragraphs

All labels

All buttons

5. Code Updates

Apply fixes to every page:

Landing page

About

Product pages

Blog

Navigation

Footer

Dashboard

B2B pages

Any subpages

6. Tailwind/CSS Tokens

Provide the exact tokens needed to unify everything visually.

IMPLEMENTATION RULE (REQUIRED)
Every section on the entire website must use:
<div class="mx-auto max-w-[1400px] px-6">
   ...content...
</div>


Or a smaller container where appropriate.

This ensures the whole site becomes tight, centered, consistent, premium, and visually identical in quality to Apple.com.
