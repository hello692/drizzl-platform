You are my Senior Product Designer + Frontend Engineer.

GOAL
Rebuild the GLOBAL TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM and text styling for the entire Drizzl Wellness site to visually match the hierarchy and feel of the Google AI “Societal impact → Access” page (screenshot reference), while keeping our brand black-and-white and wellness-focused.

IMPORTANT
- Use the Google AI page ONLY as a visual reference for:
  - font vibe (modern, wide, soft sans-serif)
  - heading size hierarchy
  - weights
  - spacing
- copy  Google fonts directly (Product Sans / Google Sans). exactly 
- Instead, choose an open-source family with a similar look:
  - Primary suggestion: `Inter` (or `DM Sans` if Inter is not available).
- All typography decisions must be implemented as a global design system (tokens + utility classes or CSS variables) and applied across ALL pages and components.

1. GLOBAL TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM
--------------------------------
Define and apply a full typography scale that visually resembles the Google AI “Access” page:

FONT FAMILY
- Base font stack:
  - `font-family: "(Product Sans / Google Sans). 
- Use normal/medium/semi-bold weights to mimic Google’s smooth but confident look.

FONT SIZES & WEIGHTS (DESKTOP BASELINE)
Approximate these values; use `rem`:

- H1 (hero titles like “I Feel Alive”):
  - Size: ~3.25rem–3.5rem (52–56px)
  - Weight: 600
  - Line-height: 1.05–1.1
  - Tracking: slightly tight

- H2 (section titles like “Access”, “Trusted by Experts”, “Loved by Customers”):
  - Size: ~2.25rem–2.5rem (36–40px)
  - Weight: 600
  - Line-height: ~1.15

- H3 (sub-section titles / card section headings):
  - Size: ~1.75rem–2rem (28–32px)
  - Weight: 500–600
  - Line-height: ~1.2

- H4 (card titles, smaller section headings):
  - Size: ~1.25rem–1.4rem (20–22px)
  - Weight: 500–600

- Body / Paragraph:
  - Size: 1rem (16px)
  - Weight: 400
  - Line-height: 1.55–1.7
  - Slightly softer grey on dark background.

- Small / Meta / Label text (e.g. “EXPERT REVIEW”, “OVER 50K FIVE STAR REVIEWS”):
  - Size: 0.75rem–0.8rem (12–13px)
  - Weight: 500
  - Letter-spacing: slightly increased (e.g. 0.08em)
  - All-caps or uppercased, as in Google AI labels.

RESPONSIVE ADJUSTMENTS
- On tablet, reduce heading sizes by ~10–15%.
- On mobile:
  - H1: ~2.25–2.5rem
  - H2: ~1.75–2rem
  - Keep body at 1rem for readability.
- Use CSS clamp() if possible so headings scale smoothly between mobile and desktop.

IMPLEMENTATION
- Define CSS variables or a theme object, for example:

  :root {
    --font-sans: "Inter", system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", sans-serif;
    --fs-h1: clamp(2.4rem, 4vw, 3.5rem);
    --fs-h2: clamp(2rem, 3vw, 2.5rem);
    --fs-h3: clamp(1.6rem, 2.4vw, 2rem);
    --fs-h4: 1.25rem;
    --fs-body: 1rem;
    --fs-small: 0.8rem;
  }

- Create utility classes or Tailwind config that maps:
  - `.heading-1`, `.heading-2`, `.heading-3`, `.heading-4`
  - `.text-body`, `.text-small`, `.text-label`
- Replace ad-hoc font sizes in components with these standardized classes.
