You are my Senior Product Designer + Frontend Engineer.

PROBLEM
Right now the site looks messy:
- Headings are all different sizes from section to section.
- Subtext / body copy sometimes looks huge, sometimes tiny.
- Spacing between titles, subtitles, and content is inconsistent.
- Some sections feel “loud”, others cramped.
Overall, the typography and section layout have **no single system**, so the site doesn’t feel like one cohesive billion-dollar brand.

GOAL
Create ONE consistent typography + layout system and apply it across the entire site so:
- All titles, subtitles, and body text feel coordinated.
- Each page and section looks balanced and intentional.
- The site has the calm, structured, premium feel of:
  https://ai.google/societal-impact/#

Use that Google AI page **ONLY as a visual reference** for:
- Type hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, body, small)
- Vertical spacing / rhythm between elements
- Max-width and line length
- Section structure and balance

Do NOT copy their text or exact font; just mimic the **design logic.**

CONSTRAINTS
- Keep our brand black + white (with subtle grey), no crazy colors.
- Keep existing content and general structure, but fix typography and spacing.
- You may adjust:
  - Font sizes
  - Line-heights
  - Margins/padding
  - Max-widths for text blocks
- You may NOT break navigation, cart, links, or routing.

--------------------------------
1) DEFINE A GLOBAL TYPOGRAPHY SCALE
--------------------------------
Define a single, global type scale for the entire site:

Use an open-source sans serif similar in feel to Google AI’s type:
- `font-family: "Inter", system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", sans-serif;`

Create these roles (not just raw sizes):
- H1: page hero titles (used only once per page)
- H2: major section titles
- H3: sub-section / card titles
- H4: small card titles / labels
- Body: normal running text
- Small: captions, fine print, meta info

Give each:
- Font-size (desktop + mobile, use rem/clamp)
- Font-weight
- Line-height
- Margin spacing below (for consistent rhythm)

Example idea (you can refine):
- H1: clamp(2.4rem, 4vw, 3.5rem), 600
- H2: clamp(2rem, 3vw, 2.6rem), 600
- H3: clamp(1.5rem, 2.2vw, 2rem), 500–600
- H4: 1.25rem, 500
- Body: 1rem, 400
- Small: 0.85rem, 400–500

Implementation:
- Define CSS variables or a theme object:
  --fs-h1, --fs-h2, --fs-h3, --fs-h4, --fs-body, --fs-small
- Create utility classes or Tailwind-style classes:
  .heading-1, .heading-2, .heading-3, .heading-4,
  .text-body, .text-small, .text-label

--------------------------------
2) STANDARDIZE TEXT SIZES ACROSS ALL SECTIONS
--------------------------------
Audit ALL pages and sections:
- Hero
- “Drizzl Kiss”
- Benefits / “Healthy made simple”
- Expert / customer review strips
- Product sections
- How it works, About, Impact, FAQ, etc.

For each piece of text:
- If it’s the main title of the page → H1
- If it’s a main section title → H2
- If it’s a subsection / card title → H3 or H4
- If it’s descriptive copy → Body
- If it’s labels or micro text → Small / label

Replace existing random font-sizes with the standardized classes:
- No more one-off 54px here, 26px there, etc.
- Every heading level should look consistent everywhere it appears.

--------------------------------
3) FIX SPACING + VERTICAL RHYTHM
--------------------------------
Use the Google AI societal impact page as a reference for:
- Vertical space between:
  - Section title and its paragraph
  - Paragraph and buttons
  - Section blocks themselves
- Comfortable line length (don’t let text stretch too wide).

Implement:
- A consistent **section padding** system:
  - e.g. 80–104px top/bottom on desktop
  - 48–64px on mobile
- A consistent **max-width** for text blocks:
  - e.g. 640–720px for long paragraphs
- Standard margins:
  - H2 → 16–24px margin-bottom
  - Paragraph → 16px margin-bottom
  - Section → 56–96px margin-bottom depending on tier

Remove:
- Random large gaps
- Tiny cramped sections
- Inconsistent padding at left/right

--------------------------------
4) ALIGN TITLE + SUBTEXT PATTERNS
--------------------------------
Define clear patterns for sections and apply them site-wide. For example:

Pattern A – Classic section:
- H2 (section title)
- Body paragraph (1–3 lines)
- Primary CTA OR grid/cards

Pattern B – Card section:
- H2 (section title, centered)
- Short subtext
- Cards with:
  - H3/H4 title
  - Body or small text

Pattern C – Hero section:
- H1 (main statement, e.g. “I Feel ____” or “Healthy made simple.”)
- Subheading (one or two lines of body/lead text)
- Button row
- Small confidence text

Make sure every section on the site fits into one of these patterns so the ENTIRE site feels coherent, not random.

--------------------------------
5) UPDATE THE GLOBAL STYLES + KEY COMPONENTS
--------------------------------
Update:
- Global CSS / theme / Tailwind config to include:
  - Typography scale
  - Max-width
  - Section padding utilities

Then update key components:
- Hero (top of homepage)
- Any “title + subtext + bullets” block (like “Healthy made simple.”)
- Review/testimonial cards
- Product cards
- FAQ titles

Ensure:
- Titles are never insanely larger in one section than another.
- Body text is always the same size across the site.
- Spacing feels similar to the Google AI reference:
  - Calm, refined, consistent.

--------------------------------
6) OUTPUT
--------------------------------
Return:
1) Updated global theme / CSS for typography + spacing.
2) Example updated markup for:
   - Hero section
   - One section with title + subtext + bullets (like “Healthy made simple.”)
   - One card grid section (e.g. reviews).
3) A short note describing:
   - Which heading/body roles to use for future sections.
   - How to keep everything consistent going forward.

Final result:
The entire site’s titles and subtext should look **coordinated, even, and intentional** — like a single, well-designed system, not a mix of random font choices. The vibe should be calm and structured like Google’s societal impact page, but fully on-brand for a black + white Drizzl Wellness smoothie website.
