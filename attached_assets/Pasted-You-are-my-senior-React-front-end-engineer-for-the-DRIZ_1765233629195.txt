BUG
When I changed the lifestyle slider photos for the ALMOND smoothie, it also changed the photos for ACAI. That means both product pages are using the SAME shared images array. I need each smoothie to have its OWN independent lifestyle gallery.

GOAL
- Each product (Acai, Almond, etc.) has its own lifestyle image list.
- Changing Almond images never changes Acai.
- Restore the original Acai lifestyle photos.
- Keep the slider UI, arrows, and scrolling behavior exactly the same.

TASKS

1) DATA: MAKE GALLERY PER PRODUCT
Find where my smoothies/products are defined (for example `smoothies.ts`, `products.ts`, etc.).

Create a `lifestyleGallery` field on each smoothie object. Example shape (adapt to existing types):

const smoothies = [
  {
    id: "acai",
    slug: "acai",
    name: "Acai",
    // existing fields...
    lifestyleGallery: [
      { src: "/images/lifestyle/acai-1.jpg", alt: "Acai lifestyle 1" },
      { src: "/images/lifestyle/acai-2.jpg", alt: "Acai lifestyle 2" },
      { src: "/images/lifestyle/acai-3.jpg", alt: "Acai lifestyle 3" }
    ]
  },
  {
    id: "almond",
    slug: "almond",
    name: "Almond",
    // existing fields...
    lifestyleGallery: [
      { src: "/images/lifestyle/almond-1.jpg", alt: "Almond lifestyle 1" },
      { src: "/images/lifestyle/almond-2.jpg", alt: "Almond lifestyle 2" },
      { src: "/images/lifestyle/almond-3.jpg", alt: "Almond lifestyle 3" }
    ]
  }
];

Use the NEW images I chose for ALMOND only inside the Almond `lifestyleGallery`.

For ACAI, RESTORE the original images that were used before I changed Almond. Use the acai-specific image files already in the repo (any with “acai” in the filename or the old list if available in the code).

Remove or stop using any global shared array like `lifestyleSlides` that is used for all products.

2) COMPONENT: USE PRODUCT-SPECIFIC GALLERY

In the product page component (e.g. `ProductPage.tsx`):

- Get the current product by slug or id from the route.
- Pass that product’s gallery into the lifestyle slider component.

Example:

const product = smoothies.find(p => p.slug === productSlug);

<LifestyleGallery slides={product?.lifestyleGallery ?? []} />

Inside the `LifestyleGallery` component, rely only on the `slides` prop:

type Slide = { src: string; alt: string };

function LifestyleGallery({ slides }: { slides: Slide[] }) {
  return (
    <section className="lifestyle-section">
      <div className="lifestyle-track">
        {slides.map((slide) => (
          <div className="lifestyle-card" key={slide.src}>
            <img src={slide.src} alt={slide.alt} />
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      {/* keep my existing arrows and scroll logic */}
    </section>
  );
}

Do NOT import a global array of slides inside `LifestyleGallery`.

3) STATE: RESET PER PRODUCT (IF NEEDED)

If the slider uses state like `currentIndex`, keep that state inside `LifestyleGallery` and reset when `slides` changes:

useEffect(() => {
  setCurrentIndex(0);
}, [slides]);

Make sure there is no global/shared state that persists between products.

4) VERIFY

- On the Acai page: show ONLY the restored Acai lifestyle photos.
- On the Almond page: show ONLY the Almond photos.
- Editing Almond’s `lifestyleGallery` must not change Acai.

Please implement all of the above and adjust filenames/types to match my existing codebase.
