You are my senior front-end engineer.

Create a hero text component for the DRIZZL landing page with a dynamic last word.

STATIC SENTENCE (everything except last word stays the same):
“Smoothies you want to kiss and feel ____”

The last word should change dynamically through this list:

- nourished
- happy
- energized
- fueled
- calm
- focused
- strong

Requirements:

1) Tech
- Use React.
- Build a reusable component, e.g. `HeroKissText.tsx`.
- Use a simple hook or small utility to rotate the last word.
- Animation should feel smooth and premium (fade or type effect), not glitchy.

2) Behavior
- Render the static part: “Smoothies you want to kiss and feel ”
- Dynamically inject the last word from the list.
- Show one word at a time.
- Hold each word for ~1.5–2 seconds.
- Transition: fade out + fade in (or soft type/erase if you prefer).
- Loop forever through the array in order.

3) Layout & styling
- Center the sentence in the hero area.
- Use the global site font (Inter).
- Make the last word visually slightly emphasized (e.g. `font-weight: 600` or subtle color shift), but still clean and classy.
- The whole sentence should be on one or two lines max and look good on desktop & mobile.

4) Code structure
- Store the static phrase and the word list in the component or a small config.
- Example pattern:

  const baseText = "Smoothies you want to kiss and feel";
  const words = ["nourished", "happy", "energized", "fueled", "calm", "focused", "strong"];

  Then render:
  `Smoothies you want to kiss and feel ` + `<span>{currentWord}</span>`

- Encapsulate the interval/timeout logic in a hook like `useRotatingWord`.

5) UX & polish
- No harsh flashes or jumps.
- Transitions should feel like a calm breathing rhythm.
- Result should look like a billion-dollar wellness brand: seductive, smooth, and emotionally engaging.

Deliver:
- The React component.
- The hook/logic for rotating the last word.
- Minimal CSS to center and style the hero line (static part + dynamic word).
