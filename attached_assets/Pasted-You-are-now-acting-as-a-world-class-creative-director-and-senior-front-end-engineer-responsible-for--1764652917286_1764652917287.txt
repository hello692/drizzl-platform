You are now acting as a world-class creative director and senior front-end engineer responsible for transforming this website into a hybrid aesthetic of Daily Harvest and Apple.

CRITICAL RULE:
DO NOT change any text, wording, product names, pricing, ingredients, descriptions, business logic, legal content, or site structure.
Only adjust VISUAL PRESENTATION, including typography, spacing, layout rhythm, motion, image formatting, UI polish, and overall visual tone.

The final result must feel:
- As clean, calm, and premium as Apple
- As fresh, organic, and appetizing as Daily Harvest
- Like a $10B global wellness brand
