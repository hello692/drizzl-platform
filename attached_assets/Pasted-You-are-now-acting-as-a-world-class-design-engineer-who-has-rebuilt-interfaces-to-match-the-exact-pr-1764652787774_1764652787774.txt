You are now acting as a world-class design engineer who has rebuilt interfaces to match the exact presentation quality of Apple.com.

DO NOT change any copy, text, wording, product names, prices, content structure, or business logic.

Your ONLY task is to transform the entire visual system to match the exact design language, layout rhythm, spacing, typography, motion, and image presentation standards of Apple’s website.

Apply the following strictly across the entire site:

TYPOGRAPHY
- Use a system font stack identical to Apple:
  - SF Pro Display / SF Pro Text equivalents
  - Fallback: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial
- Headings: Ultra-clean, bold, tight tracking
- Body text: Thin-to-regular weight, high legibility
- No decorative fonts anywhere
- Increase line height slightly for luxury clarity
- Use large hero typography with strong visual hierarchy

SPACING & LAYOUT
- Introduce massive Apple-style whitespace
- Increase padding dramatically between sections
- Use strict vertical rhythm
- Center content with strong horizontal margins
- Enforce grid precision and optical alignment
- Remove visual clutter everywhere
- Let every section “breathe”

IMAGES & MEDIA
- Keep the same images but:
  - Present them like Apple product photography
  - Clean edges
  - High contrast
  - No heavy shadows
  - No cheap overlays
  - No clutter behind products
- Product = hero
- Never crop awkwardly
- Large, cinematic framing

MOTION & INTERACTIONS
- Add Apple-level micro-interactions:
  - Gentle fade-ins
  - Smooth upward reveals
  - Parallax-style depth on scroll
- No aggressive animation
- No bouncy effects
- All motion should feel:
  - Calm
  - Expensive
  - Intentional
- Ease-in-out curves only
- Transitions must feel invisible but premium

BUTTONS & UI ELEMENTS
- Use Apple-style pill buttons or soft rectangles
- Subtle hover brightness
- Slight scale on hover
- No hard borders
- No neon colors
- No hard drop shadows

COLOR TREATMENT
- Keep existing brand colors
- Reduce saturation slightly for luxury feel
- Favor:
  - Soft blacks
  - Off-whites
  - Light greys
  - Glassy surfaces where appropriate

SECTION STRUCTURE
- Each section should feel like:
  - A keynote slide
  - A cinematic reveal
- No dense information blocks
- Break content into premium visual chunks

NAVIGATION
- Ultra-minimal
- Clean header
- Calm sticky behavior
- Apple-style spacing between nav items

GLOBAL RULE
The site should feel like:
- $10B brand
- Calm authority
- Precision engineering
- Emotional restraint
- Luxury through simplicity

DO NOT redesign content.
DO NOT rewrite text.
DO NOT invent new sections.
Only elevate the visual presentation to Apple-level polish.

Apply this transformation site-wide with full consistency.
